### What I learned
Making the social media icons to have a perfect round border was a challenge for me but i quickly googled about it and discovered i had to give them a fixed height and width in order for the borders to be a circle


### Useful resources

- [css border-radius circle](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-border-radius-circle) - This helped me to figure out how to insert a circle border.
